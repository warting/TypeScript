## Microsoft Support Policy

TypeScript releases may include new features, fixes (security and/or non-security), or a combination of both. Some critical issues may be fixed in a servicing update to the latest release. When included with a Microsoft product, TypeScript support and servicing is offered under the [Modern Support Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern). For Visual Studio, servicing fixes are limited to security fixes for versions of TypeScript included in under-support releases of Visual Studio. Community support for this project is limited to the resources listed above. Assisted support is available from a professional support engineer by opening a ticket with the [Microsoft assisted support team](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding).
